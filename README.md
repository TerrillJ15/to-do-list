# To Do List

A To Do List web application that is connected to the ATDAPI service. It will have persistent data so that every time you visit the page, the list of tasks is the same as you left it.

A list of tasks rendered in the DOM based on data from the ATDAPI server.
Each task has a description, a remove button, and a mark complete/active button.
An input element and a button that lets user add a new task.

All the Tasks of the To Do List app are on the server. When a task is created, deleted, or edited, then it will be reflected on the server as well. This app will involve DOM manipulation, AJAX, and some basic HTML/CSS.

## Deployed Website
Please note that the data is live as of this writing. The API could be shutoff at any time. Any updates made will persist so please be respectful.
