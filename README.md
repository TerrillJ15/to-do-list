# To Do List

A To Do List web application that is connected to the ATDAPI service. It will have persistent data so that every time you visit the page, the list of tasks is the same as you left it.

A list of tasks rendered in the DOM based on data from the ATDAPI server.
Each task has a description, a remove button, and a mark complete/active button.
An input element and a button that lets user add a new task.

All the Tasks of the To Do List app are on the server. When a task is created, deleted, or edited, then it will be reflected on the server as well. This app will involve DOM manipulation, AJAX, and some basic HTML/CSS.


## Scope
We will keep our To Do List features at the bare minimum. Here is the criteria:

1. A list of tasks rendered in the DOM based on data from the ATDAPI server.
2. Each task has a description, a remove button, and a mark complete/active button.
3. An input element and a button that lets user add a new task.

Add personalizations to this assignment to make it your own.

###Bonus feature

2. Sort the tasks by ID or created_at date

## Deployed Website
Please note that the data is live as of this writing. The API could be shutoff at any time. Any updates made will persist so please be respectful.
